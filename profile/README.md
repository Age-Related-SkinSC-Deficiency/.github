## Hi there 👋

This organization keep the source code for all the analysis done for the programme.

Each analysis is a repo that contains:

- A readme with a summary of the analysis done and a table of content of the repository indicating the order of each step
- A folder for each analysis step starting with a number `01_` that indicates the order and keywords that indicates the analysis itself. An example is `01_quality_control`. This folder can contain:
  - rmarkdown files
  - bash scripts
  - python or R scripts
  - config files

Each repository will have a link to [FigShare](https://figshare.com) with the results and other information generated or needed by this code. That will be added when it is available. 

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid to add results file or metadata files. Supporting files are ok if they are not big (<5MG). 

> [!NOTE]
> See an example [here](https://github.com/Age-Related-SkinSC-Deficiency/ksander_shirahama_rnaseq_mouse_cornea_hbc04967).
